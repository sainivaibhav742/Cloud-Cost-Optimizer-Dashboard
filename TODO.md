# Cloud Cost Optimizer Dashboard - Project Phases

## Phase 1: Planning and Research
- [x] Study AWS Cost Explorer API, GCP, and Azure billing APIs
- [x] Research PostgreSQL analytics queries and MongoDB alternatives
- [x] Learn cron jobs, schedulers (node-cron, Celery), and background workers
- [x] Understand data visualization best practices (Chart.js, Recharts)
- [x] Review OAuth and JWT for authentication with cloud APIs
- [x] Define project scope, choose tech stack (e.g., FastAPI or NestJS), and set up development environment

## Phase 2: Setup and Infrastructure
- [x] Set up project folder structure (e.g., /src/api, /src/jobs, /src/models, /src/services)
- [x] Initialize backend framework (FastAPI/NestJS)
- [x] Set up database (PostgreSQL or MongoDB) and create tables (e.g., cloud_costs)
- [x] Configure cloud SDKs (AWS SDK, GCP Client Library)
- [x] Set up authentication (JWT + OAuth)
- [x] Configure cron jobs for daily data fetching

## Phase 3: Backend Core Development
- [x] Implement connection to cloud billing APIs (start with AWS Cost Explorer)
- [x] Build data fetching service to gather daily cost and usage data
- [x] Develop storage logic to insert data into database daily
- [x] Create anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., idle EC2, underused RDS)
- [x] Implement recommendation generation rules (e.g., spot instances, rightsizing)
- [x] Build REST API endpoints (/costs/daily, /recommendations)

## Phase 4: Automation and Alerts
- [x] Set up cron jobs for automated daily data collection
- [x] Implement email or Slack alerts for anomalies and cost spikes
- [x] Add logging and monitoring for the service

## Phase 5: Frontend Dashboard (Optional)
- [x] Set up React application with Chart.js
- [x] Create components for total spend, cost breakdown, recommendations panel
- [x] Implement data visualization (charts for trends)
- [x] Integrate with backend APIs

## Phase 6: Testing and Deployment
- [x] Write unit tests for backend logic and API endpoints
- [x] Perform integration testing (end-to-end data flow)
- [x] Test with mock data if real cloud APIs are not available
- [x] Deploy to cloud (e.g., Docker + Render/AWS ECS)
- [x] Monitor performance and cost savings

## Phase 7: Bonus Features and Enhancements
- [x] Add AI-based recommendations (OpenAI API or regression model)
- [ ] Implement multi-cloud support (AWS + GCP + Azure)
- [x] Add budget simulation features
- [x] Integrate Slack alerts for daily cost spikes
- [ ] Optimize for scalability and add advanced analytics

## Phase 8: Documentation and Resume
- [x] Document the project (README, API docs)
- [x] Prepare resume description highlighting achievements
- [ ] Share project on GitHub or portfolio
