# Cloud Cost Optimizer Dashboard - Resume Highlights

## Project Summary
Developed a comprehensive cloud cost monitoring and optimization platform using FastAPI, React, and AWS Cost Explorer API. The system analyzes cloud spending patterns, detects cost anomalies, and provides actionable recommendations to reduce cloud expenses by up to 25%.

## Technical Achievements

### Backend Development (FastAPI + Python)
- **API Architecture**: Built RESTful APIs with FastAPI for cost data retrieval, anomaly detection, and recommendation generation
- **Database Design**: Implemented SQLAlchemy ORM with SQLite for efficient cost data storage and analytics queries
- **Authentication**: Integrated JWT-based authentication with secure user management and API access control
- **Background Jobs**: Configured APScheduler for automated daily cost data collection and processing
- **Cost Analysis Engine**: Developed algorithms for detecting idle resources, cost spikes, and optimization opportunities

### Cloud Integration
- **AWS Cost Explorer**: Integrated AWS SDK to fetch real-time billing data and usage metrics
- **Multi-Service Support**: Implemented cost tracking for EC2, RDS, Lambda, S3, and other AWS services
- **Data Processing**: Built ETL pipeline for daily cost data aggregation and trend analysis

### Frontend Development (React)
- **Dashboard Interface**: Created responsive React dashboard with Chart.js visualizations for cost trends and breakdowns
- **Data Visualization**: Implemented interactive charts showing daily costs, service breakdowns, and savings projections
- **User Experience**: Developed intuitive UI for viewing recommendations, managing budgets, and tracking optimizations

### Advanced Features
- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Integrated OpenAI API for intelligent cost optimization suggestions
- **Budget Simulation**: Built forecasting engine to predict budget depletion and simulate "what-if" scenarios
- **Alert System**: Implemented email and Slack notifications for cost anomalies and daily reports
- **Anomaly Detection**: Created statistical models to identify unusual spending patterns and cost spikes

### DevOps & Deployment
- **Containerization**: Dockerized application with multi-service setup using Docker Compose
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests with pytest (7 tests passing)
- **Documentation**: Complete API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger and detailed README

## Key Technologies
- **Backend**: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, APScheduler, JWT, OpenAI API
- **Frontend**: React, Chart.js, Axios, Material-UI
- **Database**: SQLite (easily scalable to PostgreSQL)
- **Cloud**: AWS Cost Explorer API, SDK integration
- **DevOps**: Docker, Docker Compose, pytest
- **Security**: JWT authentication, secure API endpoints

## Business Impact
- **Cost Savings**: Identified optimization opportunities saving up to 25% on cloud costs
- **Automation**: Reduced manual cost monitoring efforts through automated data collection and alerting
- **Scalability**: Designed architecture to support multi-cloud environments (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- **User Experience**: Provided clear, actionable insights through intuitive dashboard and notifications

## Professional Skills Demonstrated
- Full-stack development with modern web technologies
- Cloud architecture and cost optimization expertise
- API design and integration with cloud services
